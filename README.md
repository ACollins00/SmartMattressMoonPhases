# SmartMattressMoonPhases

### Do the phases of the moon affect sleep patterns? A smart mattress may help answer this question. Moon phases have an affect on many different things. The most notable affect is how it creates low and high tides and the human body is approximately 60% water. It reasonable to believe the moon may influence our body as well. By examining two months of sleep stats from my smart mattress and comparing it to the phases of the moon, I can see if there is a pattern. I’ll be looking at the phases of the moon and 6 specific biometrics for each night: time to fall asleep, restful minutes, restless minutes,  heart rate, heart rate variability, and breath rate. 

#### The project is done in Visual Studio Code in Jupyter Notebook. The packages needed to run the program are: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.dates, matplotlib.date drange, and datetime (pip3 install pandas, pip3 install matplotlib, pip3 install matplotlib.pyplot, pip3 install numpy.)  

## Custom Data Dictionary

| TERM | DEFINITION |
|------|------------|
|TIME TO FALL ASLEEP|the amount of time in minutes to fall asleep|
|RESTFUL|the amount of time in minutes spent in a restful state|
|RESTLESS|the amount of time in minutes spent in a restless state|
|HEART RATE|the frequency of heartbeats per minute|
|HEART RATE VARIABILITY|the amount of time between fluctuations of a heartbeat; this may reflect the body's response to stress|
|BREATH RATE|the number of breaths per minute|
|MOON PHASES|the monthly phases or cycles of the moon|

***MOON PHASES ARE ASSIGNED A NUMERICAL VALUE BASED ON THE PATICULAR PHASE IN ORDER TO SHOW ON A GRAPH. A VALUE OF 150 INDICATES THE MOON IS IN A NEW PHASE***

Note: The above CUSTOM DATA DICTIONARY demonstrates Feature 4

Feature 4: Build a custom data
dictionary and include it
either in your README or
as a separate document.
This will only apply if your
data set does not already
have a data dictionary or if
you’re building a custom 
data set.

### Features Included in Data Analysis 2 Project:

Feature 1: Read TWO data files (JSON,
CSV, Excel, etc.)

Feature 2: Clean your data and
perform a pandas merge
with your two data sets,
then calculate some new
values based on the new
data set.

Feature 3: Make 3 matplotlib or
seaborn (or another
plotting library)
visualizations to display
your data.

Feature 4: Build a custom data
dictionary and include it
either in your README or
as a separate document.
This will only apply if your
data set does not already
have a data dictionary or if
you’re building a custom 
data set.

Feature 5: Annotate your code with
markdown cells in Jupyter
Notebook, write clear code
comments, and have a
well-written README.md. Tidy
up your notebook, and make
sure you don’t have any empty
cells or incomplete cells that
don’t do anything. Make sure
it’s all functional before your
final github commit.
