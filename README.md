# SmartMattressMoonPhases

#### The project is done in Visual Studio Code in Jupyter Notebook. The packages needed to run the program are: pandas, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy (pip3 install pandas, pip3 install matplotlib, pip3 install matplotlib.pyplot, pip3 install numpy.)  

### Features Included in Data Analysis 2 Project:

Feature 1: Read TWO data files (JSON,
CSV, Excel, etc.)

Feature 2: Clean your data and
perform a pandas merge
with your two data sets,
then calculate some new
values based on the new
data set.

Extra Feature 2: Clean your data and
perform a SQL join with
your data sets using either
plain sql or the pandasql
Python library.

Feature 3: Make 3 matplotlib or
seaborn (or another
plotting library)
visualizations to display
your data.

Feature 4: Build a custom data
dictionary and include it
either in your README or
as a separate document.
This will only apply if your
data set does not already
have a data dictionary or if
you’re building a custom 
data set.

Feature 5: Annotate your code with
markdown cells in Jupyter
Notebook, write clear code
comments, and have a
well-written README.md. Tidy
up your notebook, and make
sure you don’t have any empty
cells or incomplete cells that
don’t do anything. Make sure
it’s all functional before your
final github commit.
